  <p>
    GoStint is a RESTful API to container based automation jobs
    - like Ansible, Terraform, Powershell, Kubectl/Helm, etc
    (basically anything that can be run in a container).
    Integrating with Hashicorp Vault for AppRole Authentication, Response
    Wrapping / Cubbyhole, Transit end-to-end encryption and Secret Injection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Goal is to be a Highly Available and Scaleable API for automation, allowing
    requests to be routed securely via potentially untrusted intermediaries with
    the ability to detect any interception through the use of one-time wrapping
    tokens, whilst still preventing access to the request using end-2-end
    encryption.
